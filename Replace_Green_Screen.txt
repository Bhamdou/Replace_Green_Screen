Replace 'greenscreen.jpg' and 'background.jpg' with the paths to your actual images.
The foreground image should be the one with the green screen, and the background image is what will replace 
the green screen.

This code will also resize the foreground image to match the size of the background image, 
so make sure your background image is the size you want your final image to be.
